```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-blue-500">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This solution uses `bg-blue-500` as a fallback background color. This ensures that even if the gradient is not correctly rendered, a solid blue background will be displayed.  Alternative solutions might involve using vendor prefixes for gradient support or a JavaScript based fallback.
